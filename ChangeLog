Danny Dalton / 3/17/19 / from 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM, 7:30 PM to 9:50 PM

Changed stylesheets/styles.css, skeleton.head.php, components/blame.php, index.php, backend/util.php,
    backend/submit-login.php, admin.php
Added components/message.php, .jshintrc

Description of changes:
- Removed the couple of white pixels in the bottom right
        Some explanation deserves to be here.
        Every <div> should have a 5px border radius (for curved edges) on all corners, EXCEPT for
        the background and, on PC, the navigation bar. However, CSS3 doesn't support the syntax
        div :not(.navbar, .background), so the workaround is to use div:not(.navbar):not(.background).
        When CSS4 rolls around, the former will be supported. That syntax is also supported with jQuery.
        But, uh, not quite yet for CSS3. I marked where my awkward workaround for it was.

- Added a gradient to the background overlaid from transparent to white
- Stopped body from calling a() in JavaScript since that function doesn't exist (it was a scrapped idea I had)
- blame.php's debug code now shows session status as well
- Added server message support
        The basis stems from message.php (we could optionally have loops iterate through arrays later),
        where $_SESSION["msg"] holds the message content and $_SESSION["msg_success"] is
        True if it is a success; otherwise False.

        In message.php's logic: $_SESSION["msg_success"] can be either a string with just "1" if True, or the
        empty string if False ("").

        https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26982016/php-session-false-not-set
- Added utility function to set a message cross-page.
- Login backend now sends a cross-page message depending on if it was successful.
- Login backend simply redirects to login.php if password is incorrect (with that cross-page message).
- util.php now includes a test() function that returns 1 and prints "Hello world!" if all is well.
        NOTE:
        
        include("someFile.php") DOES NOT WORK.
        Use:
        include "someFile.php"
        Save yourself. ty
- Login backend now also has a failure message if an unknown user type is detected; however, it doesn't redirect
  anywhere (where should it go?)
- Got rid of warning messages from using ECMAScript 6 features (such as const in JavaScript) by initializing a
  .jshintrc (Particularly annoying in VS Code)
- CheckUserType() function now sends a message if incorrect user type saying "you need to be X to access this page."
- Fixed front end admin page for accessibility as well as front-end design

5)

        backend/admin/remove-user.php, backend/admin/create-user.php
Added   TestCredentials

- Moved admin message code to blame.php ($_SESSION["admin_message"] can
  now be deprecated)
- Search user, remove user, and create user now use util message function
- Added a file for test credentials (since I don't quite know them and it's
  best to share stuff like that)
- Buttons now have a slight white gradient effect to match the rest of the
  look
- Moved search container below results container (will eventually
  compartmentalize that; maybe in a new directory components/admin/ ?)

7)

Danny Dalton / 3/23/19 / from 1:30 PM to 2:10 PM

Changed backend/admin/create-user.php, backend/admin/remove-user.php,
        backend/admin/search-user.php, chair.php, faculty.php,
        new_password.php, skeleton.foot.php, stylesheets/styles.css

- Fixed skeleton import in faculty.php.
- OCD'ed code structure in new_password.php.

  login page) that is white and uses transparency; I flipped
  it to be black using transparency
- Added back the image to use in skeleton foot
- Added alt text to the logo

Danny Dalton / 3/23/19 / from 11:55 PM to 12:10 AM

Changed skeleton.head.php, backend/login.php

- If not debug mode or not logged in; nav bar isn't imported
- Backend of login now returns back to login page if an error
  is encountered (specifically: submitting an empty username
  shouldn't spit a 500 error)
- Login now does something if nothing is returned from the
  database instead of a blank page
- Login now unloads session variables on incorrect password
  guess (entering a blank username would leave the set:
  $_SESSION["id_key"] === ""; to be true)

Danny Dalton / 3/24/19 / 1:10 PM

Changed components/nav.php

- If debug mode isn't on and a user isn't logged in yet, "Home"
  should not be a menu option

Danny Dalton / 3/24/19 / 2 PM

Changed home.php

- If not logged in, simply import login.php instead of redirect

11)

Danny Dalton / 3/28/2019 / from 11:30 am to 12:00 pm

Changed: util.php, components/accept-reject.php, javascript/accept_reject.js,
         chair.php, crc.php, dean.php, professor.php, supervisor.php, components/blame.php,
         skeleton.head.php
Added:   components/session_debug.php

Description of changes:

- Used phpdoc syntax to document each utility method.
  phpdoc syntax will automatically be the tooltip in many modern editors, including VS Code.
  It's also very similar to JavaDoc!
- Accept/Reject component can now be included multiple times in a page without conflict.
        From components/accept-reject.php, use includeARComponent().
- Updated pages to actually use this component.
- Tested myself - inclusion of multiple accept/reject components works perfectly okay.
  Buttons don't interfere with each other; though it's recommended they're included in different
  forms (so backend scripts only process one response.)
        The naming convention on the elements remains the same - one hidden input that is named "response,"
        and for javascript, the id is set to "ar-response-" and then a randomly generated UUID.
- Fixed an issue where spamming the "accept" button would actually toggle between accept and decline
  instead of doing nothing.
- Moved session debug code to its own component.
- components/blame.php is no longer included if you're not logged in as a student (see above bullet)

Danny Dalton / 3/28/2019 / from 11:30 pm to 12:50 am

Changed: util.php, skeleton.head.php, skeleton.foot.php, components/accept_reject.php,
         components/session_debug.php, create-user.php

Description of changes:

- Changed API_URL and DEBUG to be constants (using define()).
  Files that implement the new syntax now:
        skeleton.head.php
        components/nav.php
        skeleton.foot.php
        components/accept_reject.php
        components/session_debug.php

        That I know of, nothing else uses $DEBUG or $API_URL.
- Fixed the debug warning to warn to turn off the constant instead.
- The utility sendMail() function no longer needs to redefine $API_URL (since there's now a constant).
- The utility sendMail() function now sends RFC1341 compliant multi-part e-mails incorporating both
  a plaintext part and a pretty HTML part. Some e-mail clients can't handle HTML.
  Full standard is at https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc1341/7_2_Multipart.html .
  E-mail headers aren't exactly fun.
- util.php now has a constant defined for where e-mails are coming from.
- Improved util.php documentation.

12)

Danny Dalton / 3/30/2019 / from 2:30 pm to 4:20 pm

Changed: stylesheets/styles.css, skeleton.head.php, login.php, util.php, backend/submit-login.php,
         backend/submit-new-password.php, components/message.php
Added:   forgot.php, backend/reset-password.php

Description of changes:

- Made our project more conformant to the New Paltz style guide in terms of style.
- Log in is two words.
- Added explanatory text on the log in page saying the department secretary can create accounts.
- Added a password reset button.
- Fixed a bug where e-mails would send from:
        ">" <0@wyvern.acsl.newpaltz.edu>
        
        This was due to me using a hyphen in my constant "MAIL_FROM" rather than an understroke
        character... d'oh!
- VS code was throwing an error because checkUserTypeOfMultiple should take in "array",
  not "array[string]."
- Anyone who needs a password reset should be treated like it's their first time on the system
  and be yote to the password reset screen.
- If people are already verified, don't force them to re-verify.
- Secretaries, employers, and admins can reset passwords too.

Danny Dalton / 3/30/19 / from 8:30 pm to 9:50 pm

Changed: scripts/shared.js, components/message.php, stylesheets/styles.css,
         skeleton.head.php, home.php, backend/listApplications.phpa

- Messages are now closeable!
- Menu is now full-width on mobile.
- Logo now has appropriate spacing.
        The style guide states "the logo must have as much clear space as the letter e is tall."
        That's not the most clear thing I've ever heard; I went with using 5% of the window height
        (just as all containers do) and, on mobile, this changes to 10% of the window height (to
        accommodate for a larger logo). That should be enough at least 
- Home page redirects if logged in as admin (again). The admin shouldn't have applications assigned
  to them.
- Tidied up application listings.

13)

Danny Dalton / 3/31/19 / from 10:10 pm until 10:55 pm

Changed: util.php
Added:   backend/auto-remind.php, autorun-autoreminders.sh

- Added in auto reminders script.
- Modified HTTPS redirect (very slightly, scripts in command line now work again)
- Added in a cron script to automatically run that auto-remind script.
        The cron script just runs backend/auto-remind.php in a command line.
        auto-remind.php is made to use a command line (NOT A WEB BROWSER).

14)

Danny Dalton / 4/1/19 / from 5:30 pm until 5:40 pm

Changed: util.php
Added:  email-template/email-top.html, email-template/email-bottom.html

- Modified E-mail function to use the template (reading from the template files).
- Added e-mail template.

Thank you Beth for getting me that blank e-mail!

- Deleted the entire database. April Fool's!

15)

Danny Dalton / 4/2/19 / from 11:05 am

Changed: skeleton.head.php, components/progress-bar.php, components/blame.php,
         backend/listApplications.php, secretary.php, backend/util.php, components/message.php

- Removed statement that imports the progress bar and blame components, altogether
        The only component that skeleton head imports in its top container is now
        the debug warning.
- Removed admin message checking altogether (as that is obsolete now).
- blame.php is now a function that takes a fieldwork ID.
- progress.php is now a function that takes a fieldwork ID.
- listApplications.php now tells the user how many applications are assigned to them.
- If you're a student: listApplications returns THAT STUDENT'S applications.
- Implemented blame status!
- Implemented progress bar!
- Secretary page implements utility CheckUserType function (again).
- Added a utility clear message function.

COMMENTS:

        We don't have an official user type for the Career Resource Center,
        nor do we have one for Records and Registration.

        As a rudimentary way to check for CRC, I used the user type "crc".

        We also don't have a way to track if the application is finished.
        (If it is, the progress bar will fill to 100%.)

        Blame.php will return differently if the user isn't a student;
        It could also very well be used in Records and Registration's page.

Danny Dalton / 4/2/19 / 1:30 PM

Changed secretary.php, backend/listApplications.php

- Fixed secretary page showing nothing (used include_once instead of include)
- Fixed typo in listApplications.php

Danny Dalton / 4/2/19 / 4:00 PM to 4:55 PM

Changed student-application2.php
Added components/drop_down.php

- Added a drop-down combo-box that automatically populates from a specific table column.
- Added a functionality for conditional drop-down boxes (where conditions are SQL statements.)
- Drop-down boxes have a unique ID assigned to them.
        Drop-down boxes don't import the db right and i'm not sure why

Danny Dalton / 4/2/19 / 7:50 PM to 8:45 PM

Changed components/drop_down.php, skeleton.head.php, skeleton.foot.php, student-application2.php,
        stylesheets/styles.css, home.php, components/session_debug.php
Added   backend/update-employer.php

- Fixed my error from before! Includes are so screwy in included functions
        I had to make the path "backend/db_conn2.php" since it was running from the root in all
        technicality. I figured it would be running from components (making the include go to 
        "../backend/db_conn2.php"). ...tf?
- Moved shared JS to skeleton head.
- Finally finished implementing my autopopulating drop-down.
- Removed a colon in home.php and fixed html structure.
- Added a big header in the debug box.

Added   components/autofill_box.php, javascript/autofill.js
Changed student-application2.php, stylesheets/styles.css, update-employer.php, util.php

- Autofill boxes are now correctly implemented... woo-hoo!
        Source JS adapted from https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_autocomplete.asp .
        I also added null-checking ... having "null" be returned from the server shouldn't
        cause errors in the Console.
- Employer submission works, along with Employer ID generation.

18)

Danny Dalton / 4/4/19 / 11:25 am - 11:30 am, 11:50 am - 12:00 pm

Renamed         backend/update-employer.php => backend/update-appinfo2.php

        Using single quotes works nicely until some company's name has a single quote in it.
